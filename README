gotma: console based pomodoros

gotma is a command line utility for doing pomodoros[1]. see the man page
for more command line usage.


DEPENDENCIES
------------
gotma is written in Go, so you need to have a working Go installation.
it also uses the plan9 mk(1) system, which can be obtained from [2].


TEXT-TO-SPEECH
--------------
the program looks for an executable file named "say" in the path, expecting
that given the command line `say some text`, it will speak 'some text'.
one is provided on os x; if you have festival (or don't mind installing
festival), i've written a small 'say' program available from [3].
